Expert System

Write a set of rules, part of a "building maintenance" ES, that would be able to answer the question: "Why did the lights just go out in POST 303D"? Break the problem down into subgoals, data-gathering, etc.

Facts:

    old:            the lightbulbs are more than one year old
    in danger:      the lightbulbs are in danger of burning out
    sounds:         the lightbulbs make rattling sounds when you shake them
    M-F:            it is Monday to Friday
    burnt:          the lightbulbs are burned out
    workday:        it is a workday
    before 5:       it is before 5:00 pm
    power's out:    the power is out in POST
    available:      the electrician is available

Rules:

    IF the lightbulbs are more than one year old
    THEN the lightbulbs are in danger of burning out

    IF NOT the lightbulbs are more than one year old
    THEN NOT the lightbulbs are in danger of burning out
    
    IF the lightbulbs are in danger of burning out
    AND IF the lightbulbs make rattling sounds when you shake them
    THEN the lightbulbs are burned out

    IF NOT the lightbulbs are in danger of burning out
    THEN NOT the lightbulbs are burned out

    IF NOT the lightbulbs make rattling sounds when you shake them
    THEN NOT the lightbulbs are burned out

    IF the lightbulbs are burned out
    THEN the lights went out because the lightbulbs burned out (R1)

    IF NOT the lightbulbs are burned out
    THEN the power is out in POST

    IF the power is out in POST
    AND IF NOT the electrician is available
    THEN the lights went out because the power was out and the electrician was not on duty (R2)

    IF the power is out in POST
    AND IF the electrician is available
    THEN the lights went out because the power was out and the electrician was not skilled (R3)

    IF it is a workday
    AND IF it is before 5:00 pm
    THEN the electrician is available

    IF NOT it is a workday
    THEN NOT the electrician is available

    AND IF NOT it is before 5:00 pm
    THEN NOT the electrician is available

    IF it is Monday to Friday
    THEN it is a workday

    IF NOT it is Monday to Friday
    THEN NOT it is a workday

Conclusions:

    R1:     the lights went out because the lightbulbs burned out
    R2:     the lights went out because the power was out and the electrician was not on duty 
    R3:     the lights went out because the power was out and the electrician was not skilled

Consulting Example:

    Are the lightbulbs more than one year old?                      Yes
    Do the lightbulbs make rattling sounds when you shake them?     No
    Is it Monday to Friday?                                         Yes
    Is it before 5:00 pm?                                           Yes

Example interpretations of the given CFs

    Q: Was it before 5:00 pm when the lights went off in POST 303D?
    A: I didn't look at my watch, but I'm pretty positive that it was before 5:00 pm.
    ⇒  it is before 5:00 pm    {cf 0.8}

    Q: Were those lightbulbs more than one year old?
    A: Not sure.  It's possible.
    ⇒  the lightbulbs are more than one year old    {cf 0.2}

The forward chaining data-flow diagram for this system is illustrated as below.

Expert System for lights-go-out exercise with given CFs

With these given CFs and the ones collected from the data gathering process, we can calculate the CFs of the rest of the events in this ES.

    in danger:          {cf 0.16  = 0.2 × 0.8}
    NOT in danger:      {cf -0.16 = -0.2 × 0.8}
    burnt:              {cf -0.72 = min[0.16, -0.8] × 0.9 }
    NOT burnt:          {cf 0.685  = (0.8 × 0.9 + (-0.16) × 0.7) / (1 - min[|0.8 × 0.9|, |(-0.16) × 0.7|])}
    power's out:        {cf 0.545 = 0.685 × 0.8}
    workday:            {cf 1     = 1 × 1}
    NOT workday:        {cf 1     = -1 × 1}
    available:          {cf 0.72  = min[1, 0.8] × 0.9}
    NOT available:      {cf -1    = -1 × 1}

    R1:                 {cf -0.72 = -0.72 × 1}
    R2:                 {cf -0.9  = min[0.545, -1] × 0.9}
    R3:                 {cf 0.438 = min[0.545, 0.72] × 0.8}

Expert System for lights-go-out exercise with calculated CFs

In summary, with the given set of certainty factors, we are able the derive the certainty levels of different possible conclusions. Specifically, R2 with CF -0.9 is the most unlikely reason in the lights-out scenario, while R3 with CF 0.438 is the most likely reason.
